Before executing task verification (including workpad or user-requested checks), ensure test. Ordinary inspection does not require test. Keep the stage current.",

A new artifact alone does not mean the whole card is complete. Include outputs and nextMoves; [] when none. Pure conversation or a pause needs no delivery. After a question or blocked report, do not add a result; keep their existing nextMoves rules. Follow explicit stop/wait instructions.",
