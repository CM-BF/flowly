# Default models (global and per project)

Status: implemented on the user's request (2026-10-16): a Models page in the settings with a default model, and a default model per project that overrides it.

## 1. What it is

The model a **new session** starts with: provider, model and optional reasoning effort. It prefills the "New session" form and the agent picker of "New task → Start an agent now". The user can still change it in those forms; nothing is forced on an existing session.

The default also carries an optional **permission mode** (2026-10-23). With no mode set, the form keeps the latest session's mode when the provider is the same, else the provider default. Not covered: the summary model (separate, see §4).

## 2. Precedence

`effectiveAgentModel(project, global)` in `shared/agent-defaults.ts`, strongest first:

1. the project's `agentModel`, when set;
2. the global default (`models` host setting), when set (`defaultProvider` and `defaultModel` both non-empty);
3. nothing: the form starts from the latest session's settings, as before this feature (`startingAgent`).

A project default replaces the global one as a whole (provider, model and reasoning together); it is never merged field by field. If the chosen provider is not available on this machine the form falls back as it always did (an available provider, its default model).

## 3. Data

- Global: host-scoped setting `models` = `{ defaultProvider, defaultModel, defaultThinking, defaultMode }`, empty strings meaning none. Registered in `index.server.ts`.
- Project: optional `agentModel: { provider, model, thinking?, mode? }` on the project record. No board migration (absent on existing projects). `projects.update` takes `agentModel`; a model sets it, `null` removes it; it goes through the usual project revision check, so a stale edit is rejected. The model is validated by `agentModelSchema` (strict, non-empty ids).

## 4. UI

- **Settings → Models**: *Default model* (Provider, Model, Reasoning) and *Summary models* (an ordered fallback list; see [SUMMARY-MODELS-SPEC](SUMMARY-MODELS-SPEC.md)). Provider's first choice is **Automatic** (no default). Choosing a provider also chooses its default model, so a default is always complete.
- **Project settings → Default model**: the same three rows; the provider's first choice reads **Global default (…)** (the current global one, or Automatic) and means "no override".
- A **Permissions** row (the provider's modes; "Same as latest session" keeps none: the form then keeps the latest session's mode when it uses the same provider, else the provider default) follows Reasoning; changing the provider clears it, since mode ids belong to a provider.
- The Reasoning row only appears when the model offers options; "Model default" keeps the model's own.
