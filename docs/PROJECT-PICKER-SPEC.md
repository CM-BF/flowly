# Project directory picker and linked multi-repo projects

Status: requested by the user on 2026-10-15 (card “优化project系统”). Amends [SINGLE-ROOT-SPEC](SINGLE-ROOT-SPEC.md) for project creation only; the one-project-one-root contract is unchanged.

## 1. Choosing a directory

The plugin SDK has no host file/folder picker, and plugin client code cannot read absolute paths from a browser file chooser. Both choosers therefore run through the daemon, which owns the file system:

- **Browse (in-app).** `fs.list-directories({ path? })` returns the canonical directory, its parent, the daemon user's home and up to 500 non-hidden child directories (symlinks to directories included), each flagged `git` when it contains `.git`. Default is the home directory. Read-only. The project form shows an inline browser (Up, Home, child rows; Git repos marked) with **Use this folder** (single root) or **Add** (linked repositories). Works on every client, including phones.
- **System dialog.** `fs.pick-native({ multiple })` opens the platform folder dialog **on the computer running the Paseo daemon**: macOS Finder (`osascript choose folder`, multiple selection), Windows Explorer (`FolderBrowserDialog`, single), Linux `zenity`/`kdialog`. Cancel returns `{ paths: [] }`. One dialog at a time; a second request fails with “A folder dialog is already open.” 10-minute timeout. `fs.list-directories` reports `native` (`finder`/`explorer`/`zenity`/`kdialog`/null) so the client hides the button when unavailable. The button's detail says it opens on the Paseo computer, so a remote/phone user is not surprised.
- Typing a path remains possible. The server still canonicalizes with `realpath` and rejects non-directories.

## 2. Linked multi-repo project

The project form has a **Source** choice: *Single directory* (existing behavior) or *Multiple repositories*.

Multiple repositories:

1. The user names the project and adds two or more directories (browser, system dialog or typed path). Duplicates (after `realpath`) are rejected.
2. `projects.create-linked({ title, description, links })` creates `<plugin data>/projects/<slug>` — the fixed parent is `~/.paseo/plugin-data/paseo-ultra-kanban/projects` (override: `ULTRA_KANBAN_LINKED_DIR`). `<slug>` comes from the title (letters/digits/`-`, max 60; `project` when empty), suffixed `-2`, `-3`… when the directory already exists. The directory is new and empty; the plugin never reuses or writes into an existing user directory.
3. One symlink per target, named after the target's basename (suffixed `-2`… on collision), pointing at the canonical target. Targets must be existing directories outside the linked parent.
4. The directory is registered as a native Paseo project and bound like a single-root project. `project.links = [{ name, target }]` records the links. `repos` stays `[root]`.
5. Failure before the native project exists removes only what this call created (its symlinks and the new directory). After native registration the directory is preserved.

Editing a linked project (`projects.set-links({ id, revision, links })`, CAS on project revision) adds new symlinks and removes dropped ones. A link is removed only when the entry is still a symlink pointing at its recorded target; targets themselves are never touched. At least one link must remain. The root, native binding and existing cards/workspaces are unchanged; directory workspaces see the change immediately.

Cards in a linked project use directory workspaces (the root is not a Git repository, so worktree mode is unavailable, as for any common directory). The task context lists the links (`name -> target`) so the agent knows which real repositories it is working in. Provider sandboxes may treat the symlink targets as outside the workspace; full-access sessions are unaffected, other modes report denied access as before.

Archiving a project never deletes the linked directory or targets.

## 3. Acceptance

- Unit: linked create (directory, symlinks, name collision, native bind, cleanup on failure, duplicate/invalid targets), setLinks add/remove/CAS/foreign-entry protection, listDirectories (hidden filter, git flag, parent), native picker unavailable path.
- Typecheck and full tests; reload `paseo-ultra-kanban`; live RPC: list home directories; create a linked fixture project from two temp directories, verify native project root and symlinks, then clean up the fixture project, board record and directories.
- UI: desktop/compact form rendering in the non-fullscreen window only when it can be targeted; otherwise recorded UNRUN.
