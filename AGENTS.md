# Project constraints

## Working relationship

- Act as a colleague, not a subordinate. Before acting on a task or requirement, judge whether it is sound: does it make sense, does it conflict with the product invariants, the specs, earlier user decisions, or itself, and is there a simpler or safer way to the same goal.
- The user can be wrong. When a request contains a clear error, a contradiction with an earlier decision, or a trade-off the user seems to have missed, say so directly and plainly. Do not soften it, hedge it, or bury it after the work. Back the objection with evidence (file, spec section, invariant, concrete failure scenario) and give a recommendation.
- Raise the objection before implementing. If the problem is fundamental (breaks an invariant, loses data, contradicts an accepted decision), stop and get the user's call. If it is minor, state it, proceed with the better option, and say what you changed and why.
- Once the user has heard the objection and still decides otherwise, follow the decision and record it in the relevant spec. Do not re-argue it, and do not silently implement your own preference instead.
- Disagreement is about the work, not deference: do not agree just to please, and do not invent objections to look critical.

## Required reading and delivery order

- Read `docs/SPEC-OUTLINE.md`, the current phase spec, and `docs/PROGRESS.md` before changing code.
- The user's later single-root decision supersedes multi-repo product behavior. Read `docs/SINGLE-ROOT-SPEC.md` before modifying project, task, workspace or tool behavior.
- Phase 1 is the complete Kanban UI and Paseo resource integration. Stop after Phase 1 implementation and Luna verification for the user's acceptance. Do not start Phase 2 without the user's subsequent instruction.
- The user has authorized Phase 2 implementation and complete testing. Follow `docs/PHASE-02-SPEC.md`, use an explicitly full-access Luna 6 test session, and stop for user review after delivery.
- Write the complete phase spec before implementation. Keep observable behavior, errors, data contracts, and acceptance criteria in sync with changes. Routine implementation choices within the accepted scope do not require another approval.
- Record completed, failed, and unrun checks separately. A plugin reporting `running` alone does not prove UI or agent behavior.

## Product invariants

- One Kanban project corresponds to one native Paseo project root. New projects and cards use that root only. Users can place multiple repositories under a common directory and register that directory as the native project, or let the plugin create a linked root (a new directory under its data folder with one symlink per chosen repository, `docs/PROJECT-PICKER-SPEC.md`). There is no card repo selector; removing a link deletes only the symlink, never the target.
- Existing multi-repo project/card records are read-only legacy scope data. Preserve their workspace links, scope, activities and receipts; never move directories or reparent native resources implicitly.
- One card corresponds to one workspace; a workspace cannot be bound to two cards. Card edits do not create additional workspaces.
- A card's sessions are the sessions in its workspace. Multiple sessions are supported; users choose which session receives instructions.
- A card's ordinary follow-up sends exactly the user's text after fresh task/workspace/session authorization. Give task context at session creation or through the explicit Kanban work-instructions action; do not prepend a task header to every message.
- Card business status and session execution status are independent. A turn ending never automatically completes the card.
- Automatic assignment, multi-agent handoffs, role orchestration, cross-host scheduling, and PR automation are outside v1.
- Archiving plugin records preserves history and does not implicitly archive/delete Paseo resources or directories.
- Exception, explicit only: the user-confirmed **Remove** of a project deletes it and its cards from plugin data (after writing a backup to `removed/`). Only when the user also chooses *Also remove from Paseo*, and no session in its workspaces is running, the native Paseo project is removed too (`paseo project delete`, which keeps every folder, worktree and branch on disk). See `docs/PROJECT-REMOVE-SPEC.md`.
- Exception, explicit only: the user-confirmed **Delete permanently** of a card (any lane) deletes that card, its events, receipts and summaries from plugin data (after writing a backup to `removed/`). Only when the user chooses *Archive* in that dialog, or has *Auto archive on delete* on and the wrap-up preflight is clean, its sessions and its own workspace are archived first (running sessions block; warnings are shown). See `docs/TASK-DELETE-SPEC.md`.
- Exception, explicit only: the user-confirmed **Wrap up** of a Done/Cancelled card may archive that card's sessions, and its workspace only when it is a worktree (Paseo may then remove the worktree directory). It runs after a preflight (running sessions block; uncommitted/local-only commits require explicit acknowledgement) and archives the card last. See `docs/MULTITASK-SPEC.md`.
- Exception, user-requested: moving a card into Done/Cancelled asks whether to wrap it up (archive its sessions and its own workspace; the card stays). With the user's *Auto wrap up* setting on, the daemon does it without asking, only when the wrap-up preflight has no blockers and no warnings; otherwise it records a skip reason. A linked workspace (e.g. the project's main one) is never archived. See `docs/MULTITASK-SPEC.md`.
- Exception, user-requested: moving a card out of Done/Cancelled restores the workspace that its wrap-up archived (same workspace ID; a removed worktree is recreated on its kept branch) and the sessions archived by that wrap-up. Shared workspaces and sessions archived at other times are never touched. Until the SDK exposes workspace restore and session unarchive, `server/workspace-restore.ts` uses a short-lived local `DaemonClient` with the Paseo local credential, a temporary exception to "use the supplied SDK". See `docs/WORKSPACE-RESTORE-SPEC.md`.
- Exception, user-requested: **Mark as read** on a session also clears its native Paseo attention, and plugin start clears it for sessions already read in Flowly; *Mark as unread* stays plugin-local. Until the SDK exposes attention clearing, `server/session-reads.ts` uses the same short-lived local connection (`server/local-daemon.ts`). See `docs/SESSION-ATTENTION-SPEC.md`.

## Architecture and compatibility

- Plugin ID is `flowly` (formerly `paseo-ultra-kanban`; `migrateLegacyPluginData` copies the old plugin-data/plugin-settings dirs once, leaving them intact). Do not overwrite the separately installed `paseo-kanban` plugin.
- Root code is limited to `index.client.tsx` and `index.server.ts`. Other code belongs in `client/`, `server/`, or runtime-neutral `shared/`.
- Use the supplied Paseo SDK for resources and schema-validated RPC for plugin behavior. Never create a second Paseo connection in client UI.
- Client uses React Native primitives, host-provided modules, theme colors, and compact layouts. No HTML, DOM, CSS strings, `localStorage`, or imports of server/Node modules.
- Exception, web only: `client/web-images.ts` may listen for paste/drop on the session composer node and on the first-message fields of New task and New session (`client/image-attach.tsx`), and open the browser file chooser for image attachments (the host provides no picker). Phones get no image picker until the SDK offers one: reaching the host's `expo-image-picker` native module was declined by the user (2026-10-21). Keep it feature-detected, render nothing as HTML, and keep all other client code DOM-free.
- Exception, web only, user-approved 2026-10-20: `client/web-composer.ts` may find a session's Paseo message box (`textarea[data-composer-input]`, matched to its session through the React fiber's `agentId` prop) to fill in a suggested next step from the native Next moves card (`docs/NATIVE-SESSION-SPEC.md` §6.4). It relies on Paseo internals, not a plugin API: feature-detect everything, never throw, and fall back to copying when the box cannot be proven to belong to that session.
- Plugin-owned opens/closes, navigation (including sidebar and session preview Back), and drag/drop feedback must use consistent, short, interruptible transitions. Prefer shared React Native Animated opacity/transform primitives; keep pointer tracking and resizing immediate. Host-owned panes/modals/toasts retain host transitions. Honor system Reduce Motion, stop animation/listener work on cleanup, and cover rapid reversal/stale completion without delaying actions or retaining active subscriptions after close. Successful transient operations use native toasts rather than adding layout rows.
- Performance (`docs/PERFORMANCE-SPEC.md`): the phone's JS thread decodes every response (relay E2EE runs in JS), so poll only what is on screen and only as often as it changes. Prefer the shared queries in `client/queries.ts` (etag `*.read-changed` reads, the streamed live agent list, `sessions.tail`) to re-downloading boards, agent lists or projected timelines. Memoize list items and panes that sit under frequently re-rendering parents (`React.memo` with stable callbacks from `useStableCallback` and content-compared derived props). Loops and transitions run on the native driver; never loop an `Animated.sequence` and avoid animating layout props in hot paths. On phones, hide rather than unmount large trees for navigation. Do not remount a focused input for background data.
- Text input: use `TextBox`/`Field` from `client/ui.tsx` (the session composer has its own equivalent), never a bare controlled `TextInput`. On native the input owns its text: never feed typed text back through `value`/`defaultValue` (React Native pushes a changed value into the native view, erasing characters typed meanwhile and breaking IME composition); change the seed and remount only for outside changes. Keep expensive work out of the keystroke path: debounce it (`commitDelay`) or batch reports, and persist drafts asynchronously. Keyboard avoidance for inline inputs uses `client/keyboard.ts` (native-driver transform, cached geometry, Android timing from the host's react-native-keyboard-controller `DeviceEventEmitter` events with focus/blur fallback, Android status-bar coordinate shift). Plugins cannot import Reanimated or keyboard-controller.
- Cold start (`docs/PERFORMANCE-SPEC.md`): the host evaluates the whole unminified client bundle from source at every app launch, so bundle size is start-up time. Client code must not import `shared/i18n-all.ts`, `shared/i18n/*` or other large static data (catalogs are served by the daemon on demand), and plugin load (`contribute`) starts no network work; defer it (the session-chip poll waits 2.5 s). Check the size with the daemon's esbuild options before adding a dependency or a large table.
- Hermes (phones) gives a loop body's `const`/`let` one binding for the whole loop: a closure that runs later (press handler, timer, measure callback, registration callback) must not capture a `for` loop variable. Build it in a function call or `forEach` instead; V8/web does not show the bug.
- Pin SDK/type dependencies to the host version and keep manifest requirements correct for both daemon and client.
- UI text is translated (`docs/I18N-SPEC.md`): wrap every user-visible string in `t()`/`tn()` (English text is the key), mark module-level tables with `msg()` and translate at render, never call `t` at module load, keep compared strings as English identities, and add each new string to all catalogs in `shared/i18n/`. `npm test` fails on missing, stale or placeholder-mismatched entries. Agent-facing text and daemon errors stay English.
- Persist on the daemon. Serialize writes, validate input, use atomic replacement, reject stale edits, and preserve invalid data rather than reset it.
- CLI/MCP clients must use the running plugin service for writes; they must not mutate its data file directly.
- Use subprocess argument arrays, never shell interpolation. Do not expose tokens or unrelated user configuration in logs.

## Onboarding upkeep

- Every user-visible feature added or changed must update the new-user guidance in the same change (`docs/ONBOARDING-SPEC.md`): add or revise the matching welcome-tour copy in `client/onboarding.tsx` (concept map, loop, feature list) when the feature changes how Projects/Cards/Sessions map to Paseo, the basic loop, or a headline capability, and add a one-time tip (`tipIds` in `client/onboarding-logic.ts`, texts in `tipText` in `client/board.tsx`, priority in `nextTip`) when the feature has a moment worth pointing out. If neither is warranted, say so in the delivery note. Keep README highlights, tour copy and tips consistent, add every new string to all catalogs, extend `client/onboarding-logic.test.ts` for new tip rules, and update the spec's tip table.
- A new tip id is not in anyone's stored `tipsSeen`, so it is shown once to every user, including existing ones: that is how new features get announced. Do not add it to a stored list. Existing users were only marked seen for the tip ids that existed at that time.

## Testing and local installation

- The user explicitly requires a Paseo `codex/gpt-6-luna` session for each phase's testing. Discover actual provider/model availability; do not silently substitute a model.
- Launch all delegated/subagent sessions in full access, as explicitly requested by the user. For Codex pass `settings.modeId: "full-access"` at creation; do not rely on changing the mode after a turn has started. Discover the provider's equivalent mode when using another provider. Pass this requirement to test agents for any children they create, and stop leftover test children when the phase closes.
- Testing sessions may read source, run focused checks, and use the installed plugin against dedicated fixture projects/directories. They own test evidence, not implementation files. Tell them they are sharing the codebase and must preserve others' work.
- Do not spawn implementation agents without explicit authorization. The test-session request authorizes testing delegation.
- Run typecheck before installing/reloading. Install the local plugin under its own ID; reload it instead of restarting the daemon.
- Use isolated temporary directories and explicitly identified fixture resources. Preserve existing plugins, workspaces, sessions, projects, and data.
- Test-created Paseo projects, workspaces, sessions, cards and temporary directories must be cleaned up when the test finishes. Record their IDs/paths before creation; use `try/finally` where practical; verify cleanup in both the native Paseo registry and the plugin board. Never leave fixture projects visible for the user to clean up. Preserve only report/evidence files under `docs/verification/`. Do not delete any resource that predates that specific test or whose ownership is uncertain.
- Exception, long-lived: the **Tinylink** demo project (`docs/promo/setup.mjs`; repo at `~/Developer/personal/flowly-test/tinylink`, 6 cards, 3 Haiku sessions; IDs in the git-ignored `docs/promo/ids.json`) is the user's permanent fixture for feature tests and screenshots (`docs/promo/shots.mjs`). Never delete, remove, archive, wrap up or reset it or its directory, and do not run `docs/promo/next-moves.mjs remove` while it exists (that script only removes `tinylink-nm-*` temp fixtures). Reuse it instead of creating a new demo; a test may add its own cards or sessions to it but must clean up only what it created. The cleanup rule above applies to every other fixture.
- The user has two Paseo windows. UI tests must identify and bind the non-fullscreen window by its actual window ID/title/geometry; never interact with the user's fullscreen window. If the computer-use API cannot target that window unambiguously, stop UI actions, report the limitation, and continue non-UI checks.
- Verify actual desktop and compact UI, error behavior, persistence, resource ownership, and message delivery. Save the test-session ID and evidence in `docs/verification/`.
- Use focused tests for business invariants and recovery; avoid snapshot tests that only mirror implementation or repeat broad suites without a new reason.
